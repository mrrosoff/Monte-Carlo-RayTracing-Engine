# Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Engine Built in C++

### Building the Executable

After downloading the repository, navigate to the directory where the repository is stored.

From the Command Line, Enter The Command

``` bash
cmake . && make
```

### Running the Engine:

After You Have Built the Executable, Run The Program Using the Command 

``` bash
./raytracer [Driver File] [Ouput File] [Samples]
```

The output format for the image is the PPM model. You can open such images in most image viewers and applications such as Adobe Photoshop. The number of Samples directly coresponds to the amount of noise in the image. The higher the samples, the higher quality of an image.

### Creating Driver Files

For your convenience, example driver files have been provided under the folder titled ExampleDriverFiles. These driver
files are all fully featured to create interesting and dramatic images that showcase the features of the engine.

If you wish to create your own driver files, the following fields are required for each element:

eye X Y Z  
look X Y Z  
up X Y Z  
d Distance  
bounds Left Right Bottom Top  
res Width Height  
sphere X Y Z Radius AlbedoRed AlbedoGreen AlbedoBlue  
model RotationX RotationY RotationZ RotationTheta ScaleFactor TranslationX TranslationY TranslationZ SmoothingTheta FilePath

For Spheres and Model Material Files, optional fields exist. Appending "light", "mirror", or "glass" to the end of a sphere line or material description will activate the corresponding property for that section of the image. See reference driver files for examples.

### Where to Find OBJ Files

Finding obj files is inconsequential. Simply look up ".obj files" on the internet and choose one that fits your liking.
Make sure that you create the proper material file using the format showcases in the example files.
